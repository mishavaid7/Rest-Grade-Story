### An exploration of the DOH's Restaurant Inspection Dataset for New York City. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the [restaurant inspection data provided by the DOH](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j)

Every restaurant window in New York City has a health inspection grade that they are required to display in their establishment. I’ve always wondered how these inspections work, especially since every restaurant I’ve ever been to has somehow had an ‘A’ grade. Surely, not all eateries in the city are that clean

Nobody quite understands the grading breakdown so I looked at the raw data and [documentation](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/data.cityofnewyork.us/43nn-pn8j) that the Department of Health provides us with.
